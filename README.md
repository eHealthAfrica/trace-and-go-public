===========

A huge problem in the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa is the traceability of people that have been admitted to health facilities. Unfortunately it is a very common case that health workers pick up infected people, admit them to a health facility and the person dies without the family knowing which facility the person was admitted to or where he is buried. 

**We want to change this!**

Through assigning a unique number to every patient, on first contact and share this with the family, we can offer a text base (SMS) service that family members can query to find out the status of their loved ones. 

- See [doc/install.md](doc/install.md) for how to run the prototype
- See [doc/services.md](doc/services.md) for a list of services we are currently using
